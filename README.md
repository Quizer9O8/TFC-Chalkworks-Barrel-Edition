TFC Chalkworks: Barrel Edition is a TerraFirmaCraft-focused datapack that lets you craft the full range of [Chalk](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chalk)’s colored chalk sticks using TFC-style barrel processing instead of Vanilla-style recipes. By combining Chalk Bricks with small amounts of dyed fluid in any compatible TFC barrel, you can produce all 16 colors of chalk, from Black and Blue to White and Yellow, keeping the experience consistent with TerraFirmaCraft’s more immersive, fluid-based crafting.​

# Core features
* Adds barrel recipes that turn Chalk Bricks into colored chalk sticks using a small amount of any standard dye color as a fluid input, covering all 16 Minecraft dye colors.​

* Integrates with TerraFirmaCraft’s sealed barrel mechanics, so coloring chalk becomes part of the same time-based, fluid-processing workflow used for other advanced TFC recipes.

* Supports additional TFC addons that introduce their own barrels (such as ArborFirmaCraft), allowing those barrels to participate in the same chalk-coloring recipes without extra configuration.

Engage with TFC’s progression and infrastructure by tying chalk production to dye gathering and fluid handling.
